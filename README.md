# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

I decided to study the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) on January 2022 to improve my skills as a developer.

The purpose of this repository is to handle notes and exercises from the book.

> Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) is a computer science textbook by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professors Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman. It is known as the Wizard Book in hacker culture. It teaches fundamental principles of computer programming, including recursion, abstraction, modularity, and programming language design and implementation.

## Exercises
I decided to use Racket using [SICP Lang](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/SICP_Language.html) as the language.

Before you start, run
```bash
raco pkg install --auto sicp && raco setup
```

### Development environment
To make the development process more comfortable, since I use VSC as the main editor, I decided to use [*Dev Containers*](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). Inside the `.devcontainer` folder you can find `Dockerfile` and `devcontainer.json` to work within the *Dev Container*. 

Follow the instruction here https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers to run it on your VSC.
