Procedures are **abstactions** that describe compound operations. They assign a name to a method for doing something.

A powerful programming language should have the ability to build abstractions by assigning names to common patterns and to work in terms of the abstractions directly. In Lisp, procedures provide this ability.

We can create procedures that accepts procedures as arguments or return procedures as values to avoid repetition of common patterns. 
> Procedures that manipulate procedures are called *higher-order procedures*.
